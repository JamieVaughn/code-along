# Challenge #1:  Use the DOM API to create a simple contact form
- It should have a header with a title of "Contact Me"
- It should have an input inside a label (Bonus: add a "for" attribute and an "id" attribute)
- It should have a button with Text of "Submit"

# Challenge #2: Listen for an click event on the button and display the input value
- Use .addEventListener on the button
- Add an empty output element
- When the button is clicked take the value in the input and put it in the output

# Challenge #3: Use Template String Literals to create a new form
- The form should have an h1, an input inside a label and a button
- But this time use Interpolation to fill out the text inside each element
- You'll have to save the text in a few variables and then reference them using the interpolation syntax
