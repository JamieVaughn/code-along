# HunterClicker
## A strategic idle clicker game

You are a paleolithic Hunter who must catch his prey using the most efficient methods possible.
If you spend too much effort during the hunt for too little reward, then you may starve!

### There is more strategy to this than the typical mindless idle clicker game:

1. Choose your quarry carefully...
2. Learn new hunting techniques...
3. Track your cost/reward ratio...
4. Reach the top of the food chain!
